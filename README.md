# Prompt Eengineering

Its a strategy that machine learning engineers can use to train large language models (LLMs) so the same model can be used for different tasks without re-training.

Effective prompt engineering involves understanding the goals and limitations of the machine learning model and designing prompts that are specific and relevant to the task at hand. This can involve carefully selecting keywords, defining the scope of the prompt, and providing examples and context to help guide the model.
