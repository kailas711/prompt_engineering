# Prompt Engineering

This repository contains what i learned in the course [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) , for building more specialized applications course using OpenAI python API

What is prompt Engineering ??? - Its a strategy that machine learning engineers can use to train large language models (LLMs) so the same model can be used for different tasks without re-training.This can involve carefully selecting keywords, defining the scope of the prompt, and providing examples and context to help guide the model.
